  <h2>Pinned Repos</h2>
  <p>nps_rec_frontend and nps_rec_backend are the frontend and backend to a US National Parks System webapp that helps the user determine what national park they'd like to visit based on their interests, time of year, and weather preferences. I primarily worked on the backend and our database in MongoDB. </p>
